Note that ShortenedQuestion and ShortName are both derived from the original questions---the original questions very quite long and so we shortened them once (ShortenedQuestion), and then again (ShortName) for possible easier viewing on a vis. 

Also the answers (Yes, No, Don't know) for each subset for each country (e.g., Lesbian/Austria) may not always add up to 100% due to rounding.
